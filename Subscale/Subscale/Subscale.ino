/* Notes
  - Will be using a Teensy 4.1 to log data, that will be the primary purpose 
  - Using a BNO085 to get IMU data
    - Want angles, velocity, apogee reached, max velocity, orientation at landing
  - Using a BMP390 for alitutde calculation 
    - Want maximum altitude (apogee) (have both BNO integrate and BMP for comparisson -- 3 apogee comparissons)
  - Time of landing 
    - Will use on board clock on MCU to keep track of time 
  - Will need to log data
